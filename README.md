# Mathematics

This is my personal journey into mathematics. I am not trained and I am no expert, I am a software engineer and I am coding things up to learn. For fun. My weapon of choice is Go.

Feel free to use this code if you like. Once I have "finished" my journey in a topic I will most likely not be updating the package. I will also version the packages moving forward.
